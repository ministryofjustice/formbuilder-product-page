    <h2 id="address-14022024" class="govuk-heading-m">An easier way to ask for addresses</h2>
    <p>Asking for an address in your forms just got a lot easier with the introduction of a pre-formatted address question type.</p>
    <p>The new question type adds several text inputs in one block closely following the guidance of the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://design-system.service.gov.uk/patterns/addresses/">GOV.UK Design System</a>. This saves you from either having to build it yourself with multiple text questions or risk poor quality answers with a text area.</p>
    <p>It also helps the user save time by allowing them to autofill it with any address information saved in their browser.</p>
    <p>It can be used on both single and multi-question pages.</p>
    <p>See the user guide for more on <a class="govuk-link" href="/building-and-editing/#address-question">when and how to use the address question type</a>.</p>

    <h2 id="govuk-start-page-29012024" class="govuk-heading-m">New start page option for publishing on GOV.UK</h2>
    <p>You can now choose between 2 types of start page for your forms:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>an MoJ Forms start page - the page you've been using up to now that is created as part of your form</li>
    <li>a GOV.UK start page - which a GOV.UK publisher would create for you on GOV.UK</li>
    </ul>
    <p>With a GOV.UK start page, the page sits on GOV.UK instead of in your form. The regular start page in your form is removed and any links to the start page, such as in your form's header, are updated to point to the GOV.UK URL.</p>
    <p>Learn more about <a class="govuk-link" href="/building-and-editing/#start-page">choosing between the different start page options</a> in the user guide.</p>
