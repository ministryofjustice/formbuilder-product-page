    <h2 id="reorder-questions-29022024" class="govuk-heading-m">Questions can now be reordered on multiple question pages</h2>
    <p>Editing multiple question pages is now a little easier thanks to this new feature.</p>
    <p>Each question and content area on a multiple question page now has its own up and down buttons. These can be used to shuffle the order of components on the page. The buttons are shown when you click into the question title or content area.</p>
    <img style="width:80%" src="/images/reorder-questions-example.gif" alt="This short animation shows several questions being reordered on a multi-question page. The page title is Your contact details and there are three text questions beneath it labelled telephone number, email address and full name. The cursor moves to email address and clicks in the question. 2 buttons appear to the right of the question with arrows pointing up and down. The cursor moves to the up button and clicks. The question moves up one position. This action is repeated twice with the full name question until the questions are in the order: full name, email address and telephone number." class="screenshot-image">

  <h2 id="security-classifications-29022024" class="govuk-heading-m">Applying the Government Security Classifications Policy to forms</h2>
  <p>All data received from forms is now labelled OFFICIAL-SENSITIVE. This is to comply with the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/government-security-classifications/government-security-classifications-policy-html">Government Security Classifications Policy</a>. The label appears:</p>
  <ul>
  <li>in the body of emails containing form submission data or attachments</li>
  <li>in PDFs containing form submission data</li>
  <li>in the file name of CSVs containing form submission data</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The policy is a framework for protecting government information against compromise, loss or incorrect disclosure. Any information that is created, processed, sent or received as a part of your work for the government falls under the policy.</p>
  <p>The OFFICIAL classification covers the majority of information that is created, processed, sent or received in the public sector and by partner organisations, which could cause no more than moderate damage if compromised.</p>
  <p>The additional -SENSITIVE marking indicates that the information is not intended for public release and that it is of at least some interest to threat actors (internal or external), activists or the media. This may not always apply, depending on the nature of your form, but this extra marking ensures that all relevant data is covered.</p>
  <p>The policy also includes 2 other classifications - <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/government-security-classifications/government-security-classifications-policy-html#definitions-for-official-secret-and-top-secret">SECRET and TOP SECRET</a>. MoJ Forms should not be used if any of the information being collected has the potential to fall under these classifications.</p>

    <h2 id="address-14022024" class="govuk-heading-m">An easier way to ask for addresses</h2>
    <p>Asking for an address in your forms just got a lot easier with the introduction of a pre-formatted address question type.</p>
    <p>The new question type adds several text inputs in one block closely following the guidance of the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://design-system.service.gov.uk/patterns/addresses/">GOV.UK Design System</a>. This saves you from either having to build it yourself with multiple text questions or risk poor quality answers with a text area.</p>
    <p>It also helps the user save time by allowing them to autofill it with any address information saved in their browser.</p>
    <p>It can be used on both single and multi-question pages.</p>
    <p>See the user guide for more on <a class="govuk-link" href="/building-and-editing/#address-question">when and how to use the address question type</a>.</p>

    <h2 id="govuk-start-page-29012024" class="govuk-heading-m">New start page option for publishing on GOV.UK</h2>
    <p>You can now choose between 2 types of start page for your forms:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>an MoJ Forms start page - the page you've been using up to now that is created as part of your form</li>
    <li>a GOV.UK start page - which a GOV.UK publisher would create for you on GOV.UK</li>
    </ul>
    <p>With a GOV.UK start page, the page sits on GOV.UK instead of in your form. The regular start page in your form is removed and any links to the start page, such as in your form's header, are updated to point to the GOV.UK URL.</p>
