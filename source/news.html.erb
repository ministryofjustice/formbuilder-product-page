    <p>You can now collect the information your form users submit in comma separated values (CSV) format as well as PDF.</p>
    <p>CSV files list the answers in plain text, separated by commas. They can be imported into spreadsheets and other applications, making it easier to handle and process the information you receive. For example, you could <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/import-data-from-a-folder-with-multiple-files-power-query-94b8023c-2e66-4f6b-8c78-6a00041c90e4">import data from multiple CSV files into Microsoft Excel</a> at once.</p>
    <p>You will continue to receive information in PDF as well, even with CSV enabled. The CSV will be sent in a separate email. You will be able to choose between file formats in a future update.</p>

    <p>People filling in a textarea with a maximum answer length are now shown a counter as they approach the limit.

It keeps a count of how many characters or words are remaining or over the limit.</p>
    <p>Maximum answer length is one of the <a href="/building-and-editing/#validation">validation options</a> launched last month allowing you to specify things like the length or limits of an answer.</p>

    <p>Do you want to limit how much a user can write in your form or ensure that the information they enter is what you need? Now you can.</p>
    <p>We have introduced a range of validation options to some question types, allowing you to specify things like the length or limits of an answer. When validation is present, the form will check that the user’s answer is within the specified parameters before moving to the next page. If it isn’t, it provides a useful error message and prompts the user to revise their answer.</p>
    <p>The new options include:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>setting minimum and maximum character counts for text and text area questions (or word counts for text areas)</li>
    <li>setting minimum and maximum values for number questions</li>
    <li>setting earliest and latest dates for date questions</li>
    </ul>
    </p>Validation options are listed in the component settings menu (...) which appears when you click in the question title field.</p>
    <p>See <a href="/building-and-editing/#validation">Validating user answers</a> for details.</p>

    <h2 id="branching-launch-10032022" class="govuk-heading-m">Branching is now live in MoJ Forms</h2>
    <p>It's now possible to add logic to forms and show users different questions based on their previous answers using new branching functionality in MoJ Forms.</p>
    <p>Branching is the ability to show the people filling in your forms different pages based on their previous answers. You can create multiple routes - branches - through your form so that the people filling it in see only the questions or content that are relevant to them.</p>
    <p>Branching allows you to: 
    <ul>
    <li>improve the quality of information you receive</li>
    <li>reduce the number of submissions you get from ineligible users</li>
    <li>show users more relevant questions, making your form easier and quicker to fill in</li>
    <li>present users with information tailored to their needs and circumstances</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Branching currently works with 2 question types - radio buttons and checkboxes. You can make branching decisions based on whether the user answers the question and what answers they select. You can do this with a single question or a combination of questions.</p>
    <p>As well as the core branching functionality, we have introduced a raft of new features, including:</p>
    <ul>
    <li><a href="/building-and-editing/#start-page">A new starting template</a> - consisting of a start page, a check answers page and a confirmation page. This is to help new users understand that forms are made up of consecutive pages and also saves you from having to create check answers and confirmation pages every time.</li>
    <li><a href="/building-and-editing/#adding-pages">A new way to add pages</a> - through the new connection menu button (+) that sits on every connecting arrow.</li>
    <li><a href="/branching/#change-next-page">Changing the order of pages</a> - using the ‘change next page’ option in the new connection menu. This feature effectively allows you to point an arrow at a different page and shuffle your pages around.</li>
    <li><a href="/building-and-editing/#page-type">Exit pages</a> - a new page template to use at the end of a branch when you don’t require the user to submit any information. For example, you could tell the user that they are not eligible to continue.</li>
    <li><a href="/branching/#unconnected">Unconnected pages</a> - one consequence of branching is that pages can become unconnected. This happens when a page has no other pages leading to it. These pages are stored in a separate section of the form flow and can be brought back into your main form by changing the order of pages.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>To get started, open the connection menu at the point where you want your form to branch and select ‘Add branching’. This will create a ‘branching point’ - a page where you configure the rules for your branches. If you’d like to know a little more about how it works, or have any questions, there are detailed instructions in the user guide under <a href="/branching/">Branching and flow management</a>.</p>

    <h2 id="email-addresses-18012022" class="govuk-heading-m">A better way to collect email addresses</h2>
    <p>MoJ Forms now includes a component specifically designed for collecting email addresses.</p>
    <p>The component follows the <a href="https://design-system.service.gov.uk/patterns/email-addresses/">GOV.UK Design System pattern</a> for asking users for their email addresses. It looks like a standard text input but includes custom validation to ensure that what the user enters fits a valid email address format.</p>
    <p>You can find the email address option when adding a new single question page and when adding components to a multi-question page.</p>

  <p>Form names can now include hyphens and apostrophes.</p> 
  <p>When you create a new form, the name is used in the form's URL. To ensure we produce only valid URLs, special characters are not allowed.<p>
  <p>However, after talking to users, we know that hyphens and apostrophes are most likely to be needed in titles so we have relaxed the rules to allow them. When creating the URL, the apostrophes are stripped out. For example, a form name of Register your father-in-law's permit would result in a URL of <u>https://register-your-father-in-laws-permit.form.service.gov.uk</u>.</p>
  <p>You can <a href="https://moj-forms.service.justice.gov.uk/settings/#change-name">change the name</a> of any existing form in settings.</p>

    <h2 id="required-08122021" class="govuk-heading-m">Why your form needs check answers and confirmation pages</h2>
    <p>MoJ Forms includes a variety of page templates to help you quickly build a fully working GOV.UK-style form. How you build that form is largely up to you but one part of the form design is fixed. If you want the form to submit any information it collects from users, it must have a check answers page and a confirmation page. These pages contain the code that sends an email to your chosen inbox and without them the user data goes nowhere.</p>
    <p>We realised that might not have been clear to all users. To fix this, we recently added a small alert to the publishing page which will highlight if your form is missing a check answers page or confirmation page. Next year, as part of the branching release, we will also incorporate the check answers and confirmation pages into the new form template and add alerts to the flow view.</p>
    <p>We hope these changes will make it much clearer to all users why your form might need these pages and what to do if they are missing.</p>

    <h2 id="edge-08122021" class="govuk-heading-m">Password issue for DOM1 Edge users</h2>
    <p>People who use the Edge browser on DOM1 machines are currently unable to open forms that have been password protected. This will probably only be an issue for editors and stakeholders when testing forms before going live. The problem is due to the way we authenticate users, which MoJ IT blocks in Edge only. Other browsers are unaffected.<p>
    <p>There are a couple of easy workarounds:</p>
   <ul>
   <li>use another browser, such as Firefox or Chrome, if available</li>
   <li>failing that, remove password protection from the form</li>
   </ul>
   <p>To fix this, we need to change the way we authenticate users. For now, that’s not a priority, but we’ll be looking into it at a future date.</p>

    <h2 id="transformation-20092021" class="govuk-heading-m">Our plan to help teams transform paper forms</h2>
    <p>We have a new blog post out reporting on our discovery into the potential for a supported service to help the MoJ tackle its range of legacy paper forms. We found a broad desire among form owners to develop digital versions of their forms, but in many cases they lack expertise and capacity to do so. The discovery proposed and tested 3 different levels of support that could be extended to form owners to help them with the transformation using MoJ Forms.</p>

    <h2 id="page-names-06082021" class="govuk-heading-m">Why we ask for page names</h2>
    <p>We have made some minor changes to the way you add a new page to a form.</p>
    <p>Previously, when you added a new page to your form, we asked for a URL. Some users found this question confusing so we took another look.</p>
    <p>Each page of a form has its own unique URL - test.form.service.justice.gov.uk/<strong>page-1</strong>, test.form.service.justice.gov.uk/<strong>page-2</strong> and so on. It&rsquo;s just this last part of the URL (sometimes called the slug) we need from the user, which we realised wasn&rsquo;t clear.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>To help explain this more clearly, we have rephrased the question and added some hint text. We are also adding some additional error messages to give users an extra nudge where needed.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Longer term, we think we can take this even further and remove the need for users to name their pages altogether. That requires a little more development so has been added to our backlog.</p>

  <p>MoJ Forms uses something called markdown to let you add formatting to content. Markdown is a way of adding formatting to plain text using basic symbols and patterns.</p> 
  <p>With markdown, you can add headings, links, lists, tables and more. For example, to create a bulleted list, you start each item with an asterisk (*).</p>
  <p>You can use markdown in any content area, which you will find on content pages, as well as the start page, confirmation page and several other templates.</p>
