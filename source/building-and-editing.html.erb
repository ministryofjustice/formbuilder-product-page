        <h2 id="form-name" class="govuk-heading-m">Your form’s name and URL</h2>
        <p>When you create a new form, you need to give it a name.</p>
        <p>This name is:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>what your form will be listed as in the MoJ Forms editor</li>
        <li>the title that will appear on your form to users</li>
        <li>used in your form’s URL - for example, a name of Apply for a dog licence will produce a form URL of <u>https://apply-for-a-dog-licence.form.service.gov.uk</u></li>
        </ul>
        <p>The title can contain lowercase and uppercase letters, hypens and apostrophes. No other special characters are allowed. The name cannot start with a number but you could write it out - for example, 'two' instead of '2'.</p>
        <p>We are making some changes in this area and it is not currently possible to change your form's name in the editor. <a href="/contact">Contact us</a> whenever you want to change the name</a>.</p>

        <h2 id="start-page" class="govuk-heading-m">The starting pages</h2>
        <p>When you create a new form, you are taken to your form’s ‘pages flow’ or flow view. This shows how all the pages link together and is where you will build and edit your form. Most actions, such as adding and deleting pages, editing pages and creating branching, are launched from the flow view.</p>
        <p>You are given some default pages to help you structure your form:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>start page</li>
        <li>check answers page</li>
        <li>confirmation page</li>
        </ul>
        <img src="/images/start-pages.png" alt="A new form is created with a start page, check answers page and confirmation page." class="screenshot-image">
        <p>The start page is your form’s home page and cannot be deleted. To find out more about what should go on your start page, read the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://design-system.service.gov.uk/patterns/start-pages/">Design System guidance</a>.</p>
        <p>All your form’s question pages should come after the start page and before the check answers page.</p>
        <p>For your form to successfully submit the user data it collects, it must have the check answers and confirmation pages. If there is nothing to submit, these pages can be deleted. You would only do this if you were creating a 'smart answers' form such as <a class="govuk-link" href="https://check-how-to-get-repairs-done-in-your-rented-home.form.service.justice.gov.uk/">Check how to get repairs done in your rented home</a>.</p>
        <p>A form can only have one check answers page and one confirmation page.</p>

      <p>The flow view includes a ‘Preview’ button in the top right-hand corner.</p>
      <p>Previewing your form is a quick way to check how the form will look and work without needing to publish it. Most things in preview will behave identically to the final published form but there are a few limitations:</p> 
      <ul>
      <li>a form in preview mode will not save any information entered into it or send any emails</li>
      <li>preview links cannot be shared and will work only for you</li>

        <img src="/images/connection-menu.png" alt="The connection menu allows you to insert a range of new pages between existing pages." class="screenshot-image">
        <p>This menu enables you to select a new page from the range of available templates. See <a class="govuk-link" href="#page-type">Choosing the type of page</a> for details.</p>
        <p>When you add a new page, you need to give it a name. This will be the page’s URL slug so should be in lower case with no spaces or special characters. Separate words with hyphens. For example, in the following URL, the page name is ‘your-details’:</p>
        <p><u>https://apply-for-a-dog-licence.form.service.gov.uk/your-details</u></p>
        <p>Some names are reserved for global pages and you won’t be able to use them:<p>

      <p>Some fields are required, like the page title, and others are optional. If a text area says it is optional, you don’t have to delete it. The default text that appears in square brackets will be hidden in preview mode and when published.</p>
      <p>Most text areas are set to a specific format, such as headings and hints. Text in content areas can be <a class="govuk-link" href="#markdown">formatted using markdown</a>.</p>

        <p>When adding pages, you can choose from the following templates:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Single question page - as the name suggests, this template allows one question per page. You can choose from several question types:</li>
          <ul>
          <li><b>text</b></li>
          <li><b>text area</b></li>
          <li><b>email address</b></li>

          </ul>
        <li><b>Multiple question page</b> - this template allows you to add several question components to a single page. You can use any of the question types available on a single question page except autocomplete and file upload.</li>
        <li><b>Check answers page</b> - use this page to let users check the information they have provided. If your form requires users to submit any information, it will need a check answers page.</li>
        <li><b>Confirmation page</b> - use this page after a check answers page to let users know their data has been sent.</li>
        <li><b>Content page</b> - use this page to provide users with information without asking any questions, such as advice about the application process or the task they are trying to accomplish. You can <a class="govuk-link" href="#markdown">format the content using markdown</a> - a simple way of indicating things like headings, links and tables using text symbols.</li>
        <li><b>Exit page</b> - use this page as the final page of a flow that doesn’t require the user to submit any information. For example, you could tell a user that they are not eligible to continue based on some qualifying questions. As with content pages, you can <a class="govuk-link" href="#markdown">format the content using markdown</a>.

        <h2 id="question-formats" class="govuk-heading-m">Choosing which question format to use</h2>

        <p>Most MoJ Forms question types follow the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://design-system.service.gov.uk/">GOV.UK Design system</a> which includes useful tips on when and how to use each type.

      <h2 id="autocomplete" class="govuk-heading-m">Presenting users with a long list of options</h2>
      <p>The autocomplete question type allows you to specify a large range of options for the user to choose from, such as a list of courts or locations. It looks like a text field with a black triangle, indicating a dropdown. When the user clicks into it the list of options appears. The user can scroll through the list to select their answer or start typing to filter the options. The form will only accept answers from the options specified.</p>
      <img src="/images/autocomplete-example.gif" alt="This short animation shows an autocomplete question being filled in. The question is "Which airport did you fly from?" and there is a blank text field beneath it. The cursor moves to the text field and a dropdown appears listing UK airports. The options are filtered as the letters "l o n" are typed into the field and London Heathrow is selected." class="screenshot-image">
      <p>This format is best when there are a lot of options to choose from. Smaller numbers of options are better presented using radio buttons.</p>
      <h3 id="validation" class="govuk-heading-s">Formatting your autocomplete options</h3>
      <p>Your autocomplete options must be uploaded to MoJ Forms in a comma-separated values (CSV) file. This is a plain text format that many applications use for exporting data.</p>
      <p>The easiest way to create your autocomplete options is with a spreadsheet such as Microsoft Excel or Google Sheets. List your options in a column with a heading of ‘Text’, like this:</p>
      <table>
      <tr>
          <th>Text</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
          <td>Glasgow</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
          <td>London Gatwick</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
          <td>London Heathrow</td>
      </tr>
      </table>
      <p>You can also include a second column of information with a heading of ‘Value’. For example, you might want to associate a code or number with each option. This won’t be shown in the question but will be shown instead of the text in the PDF and CSV submitted at the end. (If you don’t provide values, the PDF and CSV will contain the text.) For example:</p>
      <table>
    <tr>
        <th>Text</th>
        <th>Value</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Glasgow</td>
        <td>GLA</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>London Gatwick</td>
        <td>LGW</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>London Heathrow</td>
        <td>LHR</td>
    </tr>
    </table>
    <p>When entering your options, ensure that:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>you have either one or 2 columns of information</li>
    <li>the headings are exactly as shown here</li>
    <li>the options are ordered alphabetically</li>
    <li>there are no blank cells</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Remember to save your options as CSV when you are ready to upload them to your form. (If your application gives you a choice of CSV types, use the standard “Comma-separated Values (.csv)” option.) There is a maximum file size of 1Mb.</p>
    <h3 id="validation" class="govuk-heading-s">Uploading your autocomplete options</h3>
    <p>To upload your options, open your autocomplete page in edit mode. Click in the question title to show the component menu (...) and select ‘Autocomplete options’.</p>
    <img src="/images/autocomplete-editor.png" alt="Screenshot of an autocomplete question being edited in MoJ Forms. The component menu is open and the autocomplete options link is highlighted." class="screenshot-image">
    <p>The page includes a blue warning message to indicate whether any options have been uploaded. After uploading, you won’t be able to see your options on the page. You will need to save your changes and test them either in <a href="#preview">preview mode</a> or after <a href="/testing-and-publishing/#test">publishing to Test</a>.</p>
    <p>It’s not currently possible to edit your options once they have been uploaded. To change the options, you will need to upload a new file.</p>

        <p>The file upload question type allows you to ask users to attach a file to their form. It supports the following file formats up to 7MB in size:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>portable document format (.pdf)</li>
        <li>comma-separated values (.csv)</li>

        <p>All questions are required by default but you can switch this setting off to make a question optional. This can be done with both single question pages and individual questions on multi-question pages.</p>

        <p>In most cases, you won’t have to worry about formatting. The page templates include fields for headings, labels and hint text and all you have to do is add your own words.</p>
        <p>Content areas allow you to use markdown to add your own formatting. These are on every content page and can be added to some other page templates as required.</p>
        <p>Markdown is a way of adding formatting to plain text using basic symbols and patterns. With markdown, you can add headings, links, lists, tables and more.
