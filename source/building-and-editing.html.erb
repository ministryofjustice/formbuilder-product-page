        <p>When you create a new form, you need to give it a name.</p>
        <p>This name is:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>what your form will be listed as in the MoJ Forms editor</li>
        <li>the title that will appear on your form to users</li>
        <li>used in your form’s URL - for example, a name of Apply for a dog licence will produce a form URL of <u>https://apply-for-a-dog-licence.form.service.gov.uk</u></li>
        </ul>
        <p>The title can contain lowercase and uppercase letters, hypens and apostrophes. No other special characters are allowed.</p>
        <p>You can change the name of your form later in the <a href="/settings/#change-name">settings</a>.</p>

        <h2 id="start-page" class="govuk-heading-m">The starting pages</h2>
        <p>When you create a new form, you are given some default pages to help you structure your form:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>start page</li>
        <li>check answers page</li>
        <li>confirmation page</li>
        </ul>
        <img src="/images/start-pages.png" alt="A new form is created with a start page, check answers page and confirmation page." class="screenshot-image">
        <p>The start page is your form’s home page and cannot be deleted. To find out more about what should go on your start page, read the <a href="https://design-system.service.gov.uk/patterns/start-pages/">Design System guidance</a>.</p>
        <p>All your form’s question pages should come after the start page and before the check answers page.</p>
        <p>For your form to successfully submit the user data it collects, it must have the check answers and confirmation pages. If there is nothing to submit, these pages can be deleted. For example, you could create a form to help users understand a complicated topic, such as <a href"https://www.gov.uk/tell-employer-or-college-about-criminal-record/check-your-conviction-caution">Check when to disclose cautions or convictions</a>.</p>
        <p>A form can only have one check answers page and one confirmation page.</p>

        <h2 id="adding-pages" class="govuk-heading-m">Adding pages</h2>
        <p>You can add pages to your form using the connection menu (+) that sits on each arrow.</p>
        <img src="/images/connection-menu.png" alt="The connection menu allows you to insert a range of new pages between existing pages." class="screenshot-image">
        <p>This menu enables you to select a new page from the range of available templates. See <a href="#page-type">Choosing the type of page</a> for details.</p>
        <p>When you add a new page, you need to give it a name. This will be the page’s URL slug so should be in lower case with no spaces or special characters. Separate words with hyphens. For example, in the following URL, the page name is ‘your-details’:</p>
        <p><u>https://apply-for-a-dog-licence.form.service.gov.uk/your-details</u></p>
        <p>Some names are reserved for global pages and you won’t be able to use them:<p>

      <p>You can open a page to edit in 2 ways: 
      <ul>
      <li>clicking directly on the page thumbnail</li>
      <li>hovering over the page thumbnail to reveal the page menu (3 dots in a circle) and selecting ‘edit page’</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Most text on a page can be edited. Just click on the text you want to change and start typing.</p> 
      <p>Some fields are required, like the page title, and others are optional. If a text area says it is optional, you don’t have to delete it. The default text that appears in square brackets will be hidden in preview mode and when published.</p>
      <p>Most text areas are set to a specific format, such as headings and hints. Text in content areas can be <a href="#markdown">formatted using markdown</a>.</p>
      <p>Some text areas cannot be edited at the moment, including the buttons.</p>

        <p>You can delete a page from the form flow view by hovering over the page thumbnail to reveal the page menu (3 dots in a circle) and selecting ‘delete page’. This cannot be undone.</p>
        <p>If you want to remove a page from your form without deleting it, you can move it to the unconnected pages section using the <a href="/branching/#change-next-page">‘change next page’</a> option.</p>

        <p>When adding pages, you can choose from the following templates:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Single question page - as the name suggests, this template allows one question per page. You can choose from several question types:</li>
          <ul>
          <li><b>text</b></li>
          <li><b>text area</b></li>
          <li><b>email address</b></li>
          <li><b>number</b></li>
          <li><b>date</b></li>
          <li><b>radio buttons</b></li>
          <li><b>checkboxes</b></li>
          <li><b>file upload</b></li>
          </ul>
        <li><b>Multiple question page</b> - this template allows you to add several question components to a single page. You can use any of the question types available on a single question page except file upload.</li>
        <li><b>Check answers page</b> - use this page to let users check the information they have provided. If your form requires users to submit any information, it will need a check answers page.</li>
        <li><b>Confirmation page</b> - use this page after a check answers page to let users know their data has been sent.</li>
        <li><b>Content page</b> - use this page to provide users with information without asking any questions, such as advice about the application process or the task they are trying to accomplish. You can <a href="#markdown">format the content using markdown</a> - a simple way of indicating things like headings, links and tables using text symbols.</li>
        <li><b>Exit page</b> - use this page as the final page of a flow that doesn’t require the user to submit any information. For example, you could tell a user that they are not eligible to continue based on some qualifying questions. As with content pages, you can <a href="#markdown">format the content using markdown</a>. Inserting an exit page will break the flow to any following pages and move them to the unconnected pages section.</li>

        <h2 id="file-upload" class="govuk-heading-m">Asking users to submit a file</h2>
        <p>The file upload question type allows you to ask users to attach a file to their form. It supports the following file formats up to 7MB in size:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>portable document format (.pdf)</li>
        <li>comma-separated values (.csv)</li>

        <li>plain text (.txt)</li>
        <li>rich text (.rtf)</li>

        <p>All questions are required by default but you can switch this setting off to make a question optional. This can be done with both single question pages and individual questions on multi-question pages.</p>
        <p>To make a question optional, first click in the question title as if you are going to edit it. This highlights the component settings button (3 dots in a circle). Clicking on the button will open the menu.</p>
        <img src="/images/required-or-optional.png" alt="The option to make a question optional is in the component settings menu." class="screenshot-image">
        <p>For now, there is only one setting, called ‘Required’. Click on this setting to open the options, where you can set it to either ‘yes’ (required) or ‘no’.</p>
        <p>MoJ Forms automatically adds ‘(optional)’ onto the end of the title of any question that isn’t required.</p>

        <h2 id="markdown" class="govuk-heading-m">Formatting content with markdown</h2>
        <p>In most cases, you won’t have to worry about formatting. The page templates include fields for headings, labels and hint text and all you have to do is add your own words.</p>
        <p>Content areas allow you to use markdown to add your own formatting. These are on every content page and can be added to some other page templates as required.</p>
        <p>Markdown is a way of adding formatting to plain text using basic symbols and patterns. With markdown, you can add headings, links, lists, tables and more. For example, to create a bulleted list, you start each item with an asterisk (*). Here is a selection of the most common markdown elements:</p>
        <table style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; text-align: left; border:1px solid #dee0e2;" border="1">
<thead>
  <tr>
    <th>Formatting</th>
    <th>Markdown </th>
    <th>Example</th>
  </tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
  <tr>
    <td>Headings</td>
    <td>Put 2, 3 or 4 hashtags at the beginning of your header, depending on the level of heading you need.</td>
    <td>## Level 2 heading<br>### Level 3 heading<br>#### Level 4 heading</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Bold</td>
    <td>Put the words you want to make bold inside double asterisks.</td>
    <td>make **these words** bold</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Italic</td>
    <td>Put the words you want in italics inside single asterisks.</td>
    <td>make *these words* italic</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Bullets</td>
    <td>Put an asterisk (or a hyphen) at the start of each item in your list and leave blank lines at the beginning and end of the list.</td>
    <td>Bulleted lists look like this: <br>* list item 1<br>* list item 2<br>* list item 3</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Numbering</td>
    <td>Put a number with a full stop and space at the start of each item and leave blank lines at the beginning and end of the list.</td>
    <td>Numbered lists look like this:<br>1. list item 1<br>2. list item 2<br>3. list item 3 </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Web links</td>
    <td>Put the link text in square brackets followed immediately by the link url in round brackets.</td>
    <td>[link to GOV.UK](https://www.gov.uk/)</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Email links</td>
    <td>Put ‘less than’ and ‘greater than’ signs around the email address.</td>
    <td>&lt;email@address.com&gt;</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Tables</td>
    <td>Use dividers (or ‘pipes’) to split your content into columns and start each row on a new line. Make sure each row has the same number of columns. Put hyphens in the second row to make the first row a header row. Leave blank lines at the beginning and end of the table.<br>(Tables do not currently display in the correct GOV.UK style.) </td>
