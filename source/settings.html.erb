      <h2 id="google-analytics" class="govuk-heading-m">Setting up Google Analytics</h2>
      <p>MoJ Forms allows you to link your form with a Google Analytics account and monitor your form’s performance.</p>
      <p>You will need:</p>
      <ul>
      <li>a Google Analytics account - if you don’t have one already, talk to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://justiceuk.sharepoint.com/sites/DemandandBusinessRelationshipManagement/SitePages/Business-Relationship-Management.aspx">Technology Services Business Relationship Management</a> about raising a service request</li>
      <li>your analytics tracking ID - see ‘Configuring Google Analytics’</li>
      </ul>
      <p>You can enable analytics on your Test and Live sites independently and add different tracking IDs. This allows you to test your analytics first and prevent test activity from being recorded in your live data.</p>
      <p>To comply with data protection regulations, users are given the option of accepting or rejecting analytics cookies when they first visit your site. This means you will only receive data for the users that actively opt-in to analytics.</p>
      <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Configuring Google Analytics</h3>
      <p>Go to: Settings > Google Analytics</p>
      <p>On this page, you can enable Google Analytics on the Test site and on the Live site. You need to enable and configure the settings for both sites separately.</p>
      <p>To enable Google Analytics on a site, check the 'Enable analytics' box. The ‘configure’ settings will then expand to show space for 3 types of tracking IDs. The tracking ID is what links your form to your Google Analytics account. You must enter at least 1 tracking ID and can potentially enter all 3.</p>
      <p>MoJ Forms supports 3 types of tracking ID:</p>
      <ul>
      <li>Universal Analytics Tracking ID - for Google’s legacy analytics service which will be retired in July 2023. This starts with UA, for example: UA-000000-2.</li>
      <li>Google Analytics 4 Measurement ID - for Google’s latest analytics service, which we recommend for all new forms. This starts with G, for example: G-0000004.</li>
      <li>Google Tag Manager Container ID - for Google Tag Manager, which is an alternative way of adding analytics code to a form. This starts with GTM, for example: GTM-000003.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>You will need to publish your form for the changes to take effect.</p>
      <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">About cookies</h3>
      <p>To comply with data protection regulations, all our forms include a default cookies statement in the footer section, along with accessibility and privacy.</p>
      <p>If you are using either Universal Analytics or Google Analytics 4, this should be sufficient to cover their use of cookies and will not require any additional work.</p>
      <p>The cookies page is temporarily uneditable while we make some changes to how our footer pages work. If you plan to use Google Tag Manager for any marketing or analytics tools other than Universal Analytics or Google Analytics 4, <a class="govuk-link" href="/contact/">contact us to discuss it</a>.</p>

        <h2 id="email-settings" class="govuk-heading-m">Collecting information by email</h2>
        <p>You can configure how you collect the information submitted by users of your form through the submission settings. Currently, the only option is to receive it by email to an address of your choice.</p>
        <p>The answers are attached to emails in PDF and can be additionally attached in comma separated values (CSV) format. CSV files list the answers in plain text, separated by commas. They can be imported into spreadsheets and other applications, making it easier to handle and process the information you receive. For example, you could <a class="govuk-link" href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/import-data-from-a-folder-with-multiple-files-power-query-94b8023c-2e66-4f6b-8c78-6a00041c90e4">import data from multiple CSV files into Microsoft Excel</a> at once.</p>
        <p>Other options, including API integration, are in development.</p>
        <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Setting up the emails</h3>
        <p>Go to: Settings > Submission settings > Collect information by email</p>
        <p>On this page, you can enable collecting information by email on the Test site and on the Live site. You need to enable and configure the settings for both sites separately. The answers are attached in a PDF and can be additionally attached in a CSV.</p>
        <p>To enable the setting on a site, check the 'Enable email' box. The 'configure' settings will then expand and allow you to enter the email address you want the emails sent to. This address should be a team email account with several authorised users to ensure you can maintain your service in the event of team changes or absences. Currently you can send the form to only one address.</p>
        <p>There are a number of other email configuration options:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>From - the email address that the emails will come from (see <a class="govuk-link" href="#from-address">Setting the address that emails come from</a>)
        <li>Subject - the subject line of the email</li>

      <p>You can configure your form to send users a confirmation email when they submit their answers. The message can be customised to your service and the user's answers will be attached in PDF.</p>
      <p>A confirmation email can be used to:</p>
      <ul>
      <li>reassure users that their information was submitted successfully</li>
      <li>allow users to double-check the information they provided and keep it for reference</li>
      <li>help you repeat and reinforce important messages from the confirmation page, such as response times and contact details</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The settings allow you to add your own subject line and message in plain text.</p>
      <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Setting up the confirmation email</h3>
      <p>To enable this feature, you will need to capture your users' email addresses using the <a class="govuk-link" href="/building-and-editing/#question-formats">email address question format</a>. You will need at least one question in this format before you can set up the confirmation email.</p>
      <p>Once you have an email address question in your form, go to: Settings > Submission settings > Send a confirmation email</p>
      <p>On this page, you can enable a confirmation email on the Test site and on the Live site. You need to enable and configure the settings for both sites separately.</p>
      <p>To enable it on a site, check the 'Enable confirmation email' box. The 'configure' panel will then expand to show the following settings:<p>
      <ul> 
      <li>From - the email address that the email will come from (see <a class="govuk-link" href="#from-address">Setting the address that emails come from</a>)</li>
      <li>To the email address captured by - the question in your form that asks the user for their email address (if there is more than one email address question in your form, you will be able to select between them)</li>
      <li>Subject - the subject line of the email</li>
      <li>Message - the body text of the email</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The PDF of the user's answers will be attached automatically. The message does not currently support any rich text formatting such as headings or bullet points.</p>

        <h2 id="from-address" class="govuk-heading-m">Setting the address that emails come from</h2>
        <p>You need to set a team email address for your form to send emails from - the 'from' address. Any emails sent by your form will show as coming from this address.</p>
        <p>By default, this is set to no-reply-moj-forms@digital.justice.gov.uk and you can test your form using this address on the Test site. However, you will need to set and validate your own address before you can publish to Live. This is so that:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>you have visibility of all error responses and replies</li>
        <li>users do not accidentally share personal information beyond your team</li>
        </ul>
        <p>As a security measure, your 'from' address must be an MoJ email address or other approved address. Any email address that has the same domain as the one you use to sign in to MoJ Forms is approved. For other addresses, you may be prompted to contact us.</p>
        <p>Your 'from' address should be a team email account with several authorised users to ensure you can maintain your service in the event of team changes or absences.</p>
        <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Updating your 'from' address</h3>
        <p>Go to: Settings > Submissing settings > 'From' address</p>
        <p>In the form field, enter and save your team email address.<p>
        <p>If you entered an approved address, this will send an email to it containing a validation link. The email will show as coming from Amazon Web Services. You must click the link in the email within 24 hours to validate the address.</p>
        <p>If the email address is not an approved address, you will be prompted to contact us to get it approved.</p>
        <p>You can return to the 'from' address settings page at any time to resend the validation link if you encounter any problems.</p>

      <h2 id="references" class="govuk-heading-m">Providing users with reference numbers</h2>
      <p>MoJ Forms can generate unique reference numbers for each submission made by your form. This can make it easier to keep track of the submissions you receive and discuss them with users should the need arise.</p>
      <img src="/images/confirmation-page-with-reference-number.png" alt="A screenshot shows the confirmation page of a form titled: Contact us about a case. The screen is dominated by a large green box which contains the message: Thank you for contacting us about a case. Your reference number is: M35-CL64-Z5Y." class="screenshot-image">
      <p>For each submission, a unique reference number is generated and inserted into:</p>
      <ul>
      <li>the confirmation page</li>
      <li>the subject and message of the <a class="govuk-link" href="/settings/#email-settings">submission email</a></li>
      <li>the PDF and CSV attachments of user answers</li>
      <li>the subject and message of the <a class="govuk-link" href="/settings/#confirmation-email">confirmation email</a></li>
      </ul>
      <p>(You will need to enable the emails separately.)</p>
      <p>MoJ Forms reference numbers are a mixture of 10 letters and numbers such as A12&#8209;B345&#8209;C67.</p>
      <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Setting up reference numbers</h3>
      <p>Go to the settings page (Settings > Reference numbers and GOV.UK Pay) and check "Enable reference numbers".</p>
      <p>This will insert a placeholder for the reference number into your confirmation page, submission email and confirmation email templates (for both Test and Live sites).</p>
      <img src="/images/reference-number-email-template.png" alt="A screenshot from the MoJ Forms editor shows the settings page for a confirmation email. The subject and message both include placeholder text indicating where the reference number will be inserted." class="screenshot-image">
      <p>You can edit the email content and use the placeholder {{reference_number}} wherever you want the reference number to appear.</p>
      <p>When you enable or disable reference numbers it will overwrite any custom text in your email templates and reset them to default text. You may therefore want to take a copy of your emails before changing this setting.</p>

      <h2 id="payment-links" class="govuk-heading-m">Taking payments through GOV.UK Pay</h2>
      <p>If you have a GOV.UK Pay account and are set up to take payments through a payment link, MoJ Forms can help you join up form submissions with payments.</p>
      <img src="/images/confirmation-page-to-gov-pay.png" alt="Two screenshots are shown alongside each other to illustrate how MoJ Forms can join up with GOV.UK Pay. The first screenshot is the confirmation page of a form titled Apply for a licence. A large blue box includes the words 'you still need to pay' and a reference number. Beneath the box is a button labelled continue to pay. A blue arrow suggests that a user would go from this page to the next screenshot which is a GOV.UK payment page. It is titled Pay for a licence application and includes the same reference number shown on the first screenshot." class="screenshot-image">
      <p>How it works:</p>
      <ul>
      <li>In GOV.UK Pay, you <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.payments.service.gov.uk/govuk-payment-pages/">create a payment link</a>.</li>
      <li>In your form, you enable GOV.UK Pay payment links and reference numbers and enter your payment link URL. </li>
      <li>MoJ Forms then combines your payment link with the reference number and inserts the new link into the confirmation page and confirmation email. (You will need to enable the <a class="govuk-link" href="/settings/#confirmation-email">confirmation email settings</a> separately.)</li>
      <li>After a user completes your form, they use the payment link to visit GOV.UK Pay to make a payment. This automatically applies the MoJ Forms reference number to the payment.</li>
      <li>You can then use the reference number to match a payment with the corresponding form submission.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>You will need to set up a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.payments.service.gov.uk/">GOV.UK Pay account</a> if you don't already have one. You can set up a test page in just a few minutes.</p>
      <p>You will also need to talk to your local finance team to set up your payment service provider and get ready to start taking payments. This step may take several weeks or months depending on the arrangements in place. For example, MoJ, HMCTS and HMPPS all have separate agreements with the Government Banking Service.</p>
      <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Setting up GOV.UK Pay payment links</h3>
      <p>Go to the settings page (Settings > Reference numbers and GOV.UK Pay) and check both settings:</p>
      <ul>
      <li>Enable reference numbers</li>
      <li>Add payment links with reference numbers</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Then enter your GOV.UK Pay payment link URL into the field provided. You get this from your GOV.UK Pay account and it should start with "https://gov.uk". When setting this up, ensure you select 'yes' when asked if your users already have a payment reference. This is the field that will be pre-filled for your users with the MoJ Forms reference number.</p>
      <p>This will then insert placeholders for the payment link into your confirmation page and confirmation email templates (for both Test and Live sites). It will also insert separate placeholders for the reference number in several places. (See <a class="govuk-link" href="#references">Providing users with reference numbers</a>.)</p>
      <img src="/images/payment-link-email-template.png" alt="A screenshot from the MoJ Forms editor shows the settings page for a confirmation email. The message includes placeholder text indicating where the payment link will be inserted." class="screenshot-image">
      <p>You can edit the email content and use the placeholder {{payment_link}} wherever you want the payment link to appear.</p>
      <p>When you enable or disable payment links it will overwrite any custom text in your email templates and reset them to default text. You may therefore want to take a copy of your emails before changing this setting.</p>
