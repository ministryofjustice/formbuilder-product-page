      <p class="govuk-body">MoJ's primary form building platform is now <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.forms.service.gov.uk/">GOV.UK Forms</a>. Service teams should consider and rule out GOV.UK Forms before considering MoJ Forms.</p>
      <p class="govuk-body">Our plan is to retire the platform once suitable alternative arrangements have been made for the services we currently host. We plan to complete this transition by the end of 2025. MoJ Forms will be maintained and supported throughout this period.</p>
      <p class="govuk-body">If you think you may still have a use case for MoJ Forms, <a class="govuk-link" href="/contact/">contact us to discuss your requirements</a>.</p>
