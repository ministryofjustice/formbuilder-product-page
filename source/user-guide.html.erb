        <p>MoJ Forms is only available to employees of MoJ and its agencies and public bodies. To request access, <a class="govuk-link" href="/contact">contact us</a> to discuss your requirements. As MoJ Forms is still in development, we need your consent to take part in ongoing research.</p>
        <p>MoJ Forms shares a login with your primary work email address so you don't need to remember a separate username or password. We currently support email addresses ending in the following domains:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>@digital.justice.gov.uk</li>
        <li>@justice.gov.uk</li>
        <li>@cica.gov.uk</li>
        <li>@judicialappointments.gov.uk</li>
        <li>@ospt.gov.uk</li>
        </ul>

        <p>MoJ Forms is a new platform with a range of features that we are working to expand. In the short term, you might encounter some limitations.
        <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Email settings</h3> 
        <p>All emails (both submission emails and confirmation emails) are being sent from no-reply-moj-forms@digital.justice.gov.uk - regardless of the address set as the <a class="govuk-link" href="/settings/#from-address">'from' address</a>. This is to prevent emails potentially being blocked or going into spam. The 'from' address continues to be the 'reply to' address for these emails.</p>
        <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Other issues</h3>
        <ul>
        <li>Password-protected forms can't be opened in Edge on DOM1 machines. We recommend using a different browser for testing and avoiding password protection on live forms.</li>
        <li>It's not currently possible to rename a page (the URL slug that you set when <a class="govuk-link" href="/building-and-editing/#adding-pages">adding a page</a>). <a class="govuk-link" href="/contact/">Contact us</a> to change this.</li>
        <li>It's not currently possible to delete or unpublish a form (removing it from live). <a class="govuk-link" href="/contact/">Contact us</a> to do this.</li>

        <p>If you need help doing something or think you have found a bug (something doesnâ€™t work as you expected), <a class="govuk-link" href="/contact/">Contact us by email or on Slack</a>.
        <p>When reporting a bug, make sure to include:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>what you expected to happen</li>
        <li>what actually happened</li>
        <li>what steps to take to reproduce the behaviour</li>
        <li>the browser version and operating system you are using</li>
        <li>screenshots of any relevant pages and messages</li>

        <p>You can send feedback at any time using the red feedback button on the right hand side of the screen, as shown here:</p>
        <img src="/images/give-feedback.png" alt="The red feedback button will appear on every page in MoJ Forms so you can provide feedback at any point." class="screenshot-image">
        <p>This appears on every page, so you can provide feedback on whatever you are doing.</p>
        <p>Certain actions or URLs may trigger specific questions from us. You'll see these as on-page surveys.</p>
