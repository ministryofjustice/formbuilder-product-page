        <p>MoJ Forms is only available to employees of MoJ and its agencies and public bodies. To request access, <a class="govuk-link" href="/contact">contact us</a> to discuss your requirements. As MoJ Forms is still in development, we need your consent to take part in ongoing research.</p>
        <p>MoJ Forms shares a login with your primary work email address so you don't need to remember a separate username or password. We currently support email addresses ending in the following domains:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>@digital.justice.gov.uk</li>
        <li>@justice.gov.uk</li>
        <li>@cica.gov.uk</li>
        <li>@judicialappointments.gov.uk</li>
        <li>@ospt.gov.uk</li>
        <li>@ccrc.gov.uk</li>

        <p>MoJ Forms is a new platform with a range of features that we are working to expand. In the short term, you might encounter some limitations, including:
        <ul>
        <li>Password-protected forms can't be opened in Edge on DOM1 machines. We recommend using a different browser for testing and avoiding password protection on live forms.</li>
        <li>It's not currently possible to rename a page (the URL slug that you set when <a class="govuk-link" href="/building-and-editing/#adding-pages">adding a page</a>). <a class="govuk-link" href="/contact/">Contact us</a> to change this.</li>
        <li>It's not currently possible to delete or unpublish a form (removing it from live). <a class="govuk-link" href="/contact/">Contact us</a> to do this.</li>
        </ul>
