        <p>MoJ Forms is a new platform with a range of features that we are working to expand. In the short term, you might encounter some limitations. These include:
        <ul>
        <li>renaming, moving and deleting pages is not currently possible</li>
        <li>deleting and unpublishing forms (removing them from live) is not currently possible</li>
        <li>tables created using markdown are not displayed in GOV.UK style</li>
        </ul>
        <p><a href="/contact/">Contact us</a> for help if you need to do any of these things.</p>
