        <p>You may see alerts on the publishing page to prompt you about a number of potentially overlooked settings:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>if your form is missing a check answers page or confirmation page</li>
        <li>if your form is missing submission settings on either Test or Live sites</li>
        </ul>
        <p>You will need to fix these issues if you want the data a user submits to go anywhere.</p>

        <p>MoJ Forms comes with both a Test site and Live site.<p>
        <p>The Test site is for checking your form, sharing it with colleagues and stakeholders and gathering feedback. You can make multiple changes and updates to the Test site without needing to publish to Live. All test forms are protected by username and password, which you set when publishing.</p>
        <p>The Live site is where your final form will live. You only need to publish to Live when you are happy with your form on the Test site. Live forms can be protected with a username and password if required.</p>
        <p>Test forms have the URL: your-form-name.dev.form.service.justice.gov.uk<br>
        Live forms have the URL: your-form-name.form.service.justice.gov.uk</p>
        
        <p>Both the Test and Live sites:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>are on the internet, so there are no restrictions on who you can share the links with</li>
        <li>will not be found and listed on search engines</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We recommend you always publish and test your form on the Test site before publishing to Live.</p>

        <h2 id="test" class="govuk-heading-m">Publishing to Test</h2>
        <p>To publish your form to the Test site, go to the publishing page and select ‘publish to Test’. This will publish the latest version of your form in the editor to the Test site. You can see when your form was last updated by checking the ‘version’ date and time at the top of the page.</p>
        <p>You will be asked to set a username and password for your form which will be required to view the form. All forms on the Test site are protected in this way. You will need to share these credentials with anyone you want to view the form.</p>
        <p>If you forget what username and password you set, you can simply re-publish your form and set new details. These will replace your previous username and password.</p>
        <p>After publishing to Test, your form’s URL will be available from the publishing page.</p>    
        <p>It can take up to 15 minutes for the form to be visible the first time you publish it to Test. Updates are much quicker and should publish within a minute or less. (You may need to refresh your browser or clear your cache.)</p>

        <p>To publish your form to the Live site, go to the publishing page and select ‘publish to Live’. This will publish the latest version of your form in the editor to the Live site. You can see when your form was last updated by checking the ‘version’ date and time at the top of the page.</p> 
        <p>After selecting ‘publish to Live’, you will be presented with 2 options:</p> 
        <ul>
        <li>allow anyone with the link to view</li>
        <li>set a username and password</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If you set a username and password, you will need to share these with anyone you want to view the form. If you forget what username and password you set, you can simply re-publish your form and set new details. These will replace your previous username and password.</p>
